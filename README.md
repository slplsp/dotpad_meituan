PS. The contribution percentages for this project were evaluated by the team leader (**진수림**) based on actual participation. In this project, **진수림** made the greatest contributions, with **수림봉** providing substantial assistance. The other two team members had minimal involvement in the project development, making only minor adjustments to the layout of a single screen in the frontend.
Additionally, the PPT and presentation drafts created by the other two members were of low quality, with logical inconsistencies, incomplete content, and numerous AI-generated sections. These required secondary revisions by the team leader and **수림봉** before they could be finalized for submission.
This assessment is based solely on the team leader's perspective. If there are any concerns regarding the contribution evaluation, please contact the team leader for further clarification.
